# BCSV Performance Comparison Summary

## Test Results Overview

All tests performed with **32 columns** using identical schemas for fair comparison.
Both tests optimized with `createRow()` outside the loop.

### Static Interface Performance (large_static_32col_test)
- **Write Speed**: 85,034 rows/second
- **Read Speed**: 917,431 rows/second  
- **File Size**: 10.07 MB (105.52 bytes/row)
- **Write Time**: 1,176 ms
- **Read Time**: 109 ms

### Flexible Interface Performance (flexible_32col_test)  
- **Write Speed**: 49,554 rows/second
- **Read Speed**: 833,333 rows/second
- **File Size**: 9.96 MB (104.46 bytes/row)
- **Write Time**: 2,018 ms
- **Read Time**: 120 ms

## Performance Comparison

### Write Performance
- **Static Interface**: 85,034 rows/sec
- **Flexible Interface**: 49,554 rows/sec
- **Static Advantage**: **1.72x faster** writes

### Read Performance
- **Static Interface**: 917,431 rows/sec
- **Flexible Interface**: 833,333 rows/sec
- **Static Advantage**: **1.10x faster** reads

### File Size Efficiency
- **Static Interface**: 105.52 bytes/row
- **Flexible Interface**: 104.46 bytes/row
- **Difference**: Virtually identical (1% difference)

## Key Findings

1. **File Format Compatibility**: Both interfaces produce nearly identical file sizes, confirming they use the same binary format

2. **Write Performance**: Static interface provides significant write performance advantage (72% faster)

3. **Read Performance**: Static interface provides moderate read performance advantage (10% faster)

4. **Optimization Impact**: Moving `createRow()` outside the loop provided substantial performance improvements for both interfaces

## Previous 200-Column Test (Flexible Interface)
For reference, the flexible interface with 200 columns:
- **Write Speed**: 7,235 rows/second (optimized)
- **Read Speed**: 114,286 rows/second
- **File Size**: 63.26 MB (663.75 bytes/row)

## Recommendations

### Choose Static Interface When:
- **Performance is critical** (especially write-heavy workloads)
- **Schema is known at compile time**
- **Maximum type safety is required**
- Writing large datasets frequently

### Choose Flexible Interface When:
- **Schema flexibility is needed** (runtime column definitions)
- **Dynamic data structures** are required
- **Moderate performance is acceptable**
- Schema changes frequently or is determined at runtime

### Optimization Best Practices:
1. **Always move `createRow()` outside loops** for significant performance gains
2. **Reuse row objects** when writing multiple rows
3. **Use static interface** for performance-critical applications
4. **Both interfaces are fully compatible** - files can be read by either interface
