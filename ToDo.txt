1. refactor interface, get rid of shared_ptrs reduce complexity 

2. Add BLOB data type
3. change column order, column order at the API level still follows user definition, but for serialization ensure String and BLOB are most right, while bool is most left
4. Use bitmaps to hold bools
5. Introduce ZeroOrderHold (ZoH), to reduce file size:
    - first row per paket always is fully populated (keyframe)
    - ZeroOrderHold infromation is stored in a bitmask/bitmap, most left in each row, 0 indicates a change, 1 indicates same as before,
    - bitmask for ZoH and bool parameter to be united into one big mask, apply padding for byte alignment, i.e. 33columns with 3 bools would result in a bitmask of 33bits -> 5bytes = 40bits
